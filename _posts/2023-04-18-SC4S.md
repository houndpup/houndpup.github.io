## SC4S Demystified

I titled this article 'SC4S Demystified' selfishly due to the fact that it took me years to uncover and eventually understand how great this tool is. With this blog I hope to help you understand what exactly SC4S is and why you should think about using it.

For three years I was a Syslog admin and most often worked with traditional Syslog infrastructure. The architecture I managed was generally pick your flavor (syslog-ng, rsyslog, etc) and run it across a load balanced server farm, sometimes across various locations. This is common throughout the industry and it worked great for years... tbh, it probably still does for most. 

So why change it you ask? There are two factors that are putting many of these traditional syslog architectures at risk.

1. Companies moving to the cloud and the modernization of infrastructure
2. Geographically dispersed datacenters (cloud and on-premise) 

### The move to the Cloud and Modernization of Infrastructure
I'll dig into each of these topics and explain why they put the traditional syslog architectures at risk.

Most companies are moving to the cloud, quickly. (see picture below) The Cloud offers countless benefits and we won't jump into each of these but I think it's safe to say we all can agree on atleast one: availability, scalability, reliability, and elasticity. Companies are also modernizing their infrastructure and moving towards a container and serverless application approach.

Being a Linux and Syslog admin, I'll be the first to admit that I used to take pride in caring for a server(s) that I owned. It's a sterotypical example of the pet vs. cattle concept that DevOps has introduced. If you haven't looked into this concept, I highly recommend it... even if you're in Cyber. But, with the old server approach comes a lot of negatives. Cost is a huge factor, for example, building and maintaining a server farm solely for the purpose running syslog-ng is extremely expensive. It's tough to nail down exactly what resources are needed and you may find yourself overutilizing, which will cost you or undersizing which will hurt you in terms of performance. Maintenance is also rough. Having to maintain an entire server comes with a lot of responsibility. You are not just responsible for keeping the application updated, you're likely also tasked with patching, OS configurations, networking, etc. Take from this two points: the move to cloud is likely inevitable and managing traditional servers is a pain in the ass. So start thinking about how you're going to adapt as a syslog admin.

### Geographically dispersed datacenters
Chances are, your company has multiple datacenters spread out over a country or countries. This is either due to the fact that you have a high-availability/disaster recovery plan in place (kudos to you, DR teams.), or maybe your company made an acquisition that had a datacenter elsewhere. And if you've already made the jump to cloud, you're likely in multiple AZ's or regions for the purpose of HA. Following best practice, it is recommended to place the syslog infrastructure as close to the edge and the data sources as possible. It may be difficult or expensive to place farms of servers dedicated to syslog across the globe. I've included a diagram below that shows the recommended approach for SC4S architecture.

### Where have you been all my life, SC4S?

This is where I'd like to introduce you to SC4S. To sum up SC4S in a nutshell, it is a containerized package that offers prebuilt configurations to seamlessly operate their syslog architecture. Gone are the days of having to manage giant server farms and keep up with an ever-growing configuration file(s). Also gone are the rising costs of having to maintain and manage those servers.

SC4S is a package that at it's highest level includes a container. Inside of the container is the syslog-ng program and the configurations and dependencies needed to run the program and that's it. This tool comes in just about every flavor of container and also has a BYOL option. See the below link for download.

Since it runs inside of a container, it requires far less resources and is much simpler to manage. It leaves a smaller footprint and is much easier to spread out geographically as well.

#### A few additional benefits of SC4S:
1. Out-of-the-box configurations
2. Supported by Splunk
3. HEC
4. Talent required to support

### Why?
SC4S applies metadata and sourcetypes data based on the Syslog filter that is used. This saves alot of time and allow for more smooth sailing when it comes to getting data in.

I can vividly remember multiple situations where I felt helpless as a syslog admin where I had no support due to the fact that I was using an open source edition of Syslog-ng. I was in such a tight bind once that I actually reached out to the creator of the tool to ask him what he would do. Believe it or not he answered (shoutout to Balasz :p), but, morale of the story is... support is important. SC4S offers traditional Splunk support and is available to help should you run into issues with the tool.

OOTB is one of the main reasons that SC4S was created. Admins were spending way too much time creating complicated filters and updating syntax inside of syslog configuration files. SC4S ships with out of the box filters for just about every data source you could imagine that passes through syslog. As the filter is used, metadata and sourcetyping are applied and the data is forwarded. This process removes the need to manage a UF on the servers, saving a lot of time.

SC4S uses the HEC for forwarding data to Splunk. I am a big fan of the HEC for one main reason, it implements inherently smart forwarding and allows for a more balanced data distribution downstream when the logs arrive at the indexer tier. If you are using a UF on a traditional syslog setup, you may run into issues forwarding/receiving the data if you're not properly load balancing across your indexing tier. Using the HEC as the forwarding mechanism ultimately leads to significantly enhanced search performance.

And lastly, I think that implementing SC4S is much easier than standing up a traditional syslog farm. I think companies will have an easier time finding folks that have the ability to install SC4S and manage it than finding someone with syslog experience. 


### Farewell
I hope you learned atleast one thing from reading this and I challenge you to ask yourself "Why haven't I implemented this yet?".
